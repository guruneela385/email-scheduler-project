* Optionally attach files (images, PDFs, videos, documents) to emails.
* View all scheduled messages.
* Cancel pending scheduled messages.
* Edit pending scheduled messages (subject, message, new attachment).
* Uses a MySQL database to store message details.
* Emails are sent securely via Gmail SMTP.

## Technologies Used
